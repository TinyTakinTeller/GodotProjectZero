## Development setup

### Setup the GDScript Toolkit
This project uses the [Format on Save](https://github.com/ryan-haskell/gdformat-on-save) and [gdLinter](https://github.com/el-falso/gdlinter) plugins.
Both of these depend on the [GDScript Toolkit](https://github.com/Scony/godot-gdscript-toolkit) python package being installed.
You can install this dependency globally or in a virtual environment.

#### To install globally
This is the standard way described in the documentation of the package
```
pip3 install "gdtoolkit==4.*"
```

#### To install in a virtual environment
If you're on Windows, this project has some custom code in the "Format on Save" and "gdLinter" plugins to make it work with a `venv/` directory in the root of the project.
```
cd <path/to/this/project>
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

pip3 install "gdtoolkit==4.*"
```
Remarks 
1. The `venv/` directory is in the `.gitignore`, so won't be committed to git
2. Because of the custom code, the `venv` integration will break when we update the plugins
